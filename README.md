# The UI mandatory guide (uinomicon)
Hi, we're a group of people with different skills related to digital product development: Product/UX designers, Frontend/Backend developers, and Visual designers.

We run the [UI Guideline](https://www.uiguideline.com/) project in order to start a process that should've started many years ago: **Standardize the design and development of UI Components**.

We'll start by standardizing the names of the most-used components nowadays so that later we could focus on more detailed aspects such as component's props, states, good practices, code templates written initially in VueJS, Angular and React, among others factors that would make UI Guideline the mandatory guide for every UI designer and developer.
